Hi, I'm very surprised and pleased that you have found my blog. Hope you find something here.

In fact, this blog was not created for anything special. It was created because I wanted to take notes of something 
interesting or something I learned, so that if I ever forget, I can look back on it.

Generally, I enjoy exploring something new, and I am currently learning to write open-source, you can see 
[eql](https://github.com/qunv/eql) - my first open-source project,
and would be happy to receive any feed back.
