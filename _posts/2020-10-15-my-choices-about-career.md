Recently, I had been decided what kind of software industry field which should be followed. Humm, there are many choices
and it makes me confusing. Back in the past, when I was a college freshman, at this time and also the first time, I was
approached the concept of software in a real working environment that is the backend, frontend, database design,...And
during college time, I tried the mobile field with IOS using Swift, the challenge myself with Machine Learning. Finally,
in the current time, I will concentrate totally on building my backend skills. Reveal a litle, blockchain is a target
field in my future tunnel :D.

In this post, I am willing to show my programming language which I choose is Golang...that's great!

### First step...Choosing a programming language

Ahw, nothing to say about this, you can find Golang strengths by searching in Google...At first glance, it has simple
syntax, strong concurrency, and support by Google.
This is the best choice for me to develop my backend skill.

Aha, you can see, my first step is done...

### What is the offical tutorial for your programming language?

Hum, as mentioned above, Golang is designed at Google, a giant technical company and the best way to learn is through
the offical tutorial. The list that you can follow is:

- [A tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/)

+ [Tutorial by Le The Thong](https://hongthele.blogspot.com/2018/11/concurrency-trong-go.html) (Vietnamese version)

* [Of course, golang by example](https://gobyexample.com/)

- [Building Blockchain in Go](https://jeiwan.net/posts/building-blockchain-in-go-part-1/) with 7 series

### Finally

Keep learning, there are many tutorials you can follow, a lot of knowledge must learn, may be challenged but
fighting...!
