### Introduction

In my work, I have participated in backend development for Identity Service(IDS) Application through which users can
register our services for their purposes like OCR, Face Matching,... So I want to design how to store the set of
services each user registers.

For simple, imagine the set of service keys are OCR, FM, LC, SCI. The usual way is to use a string array (`[]string`),
or a map whose key is string and bool is value (`map[string]bool`)

Of course, both ways will work, but I found a way that will make storing and processing keys cooler and more efficient
using [Bitmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_(computing))

### Interlude

Let's talk about `Bits` a bit and understand that computers store a byte (8 bits).

Every bit position perform a power of two.

```text
bit     | 2⁷| 2⁶| 2⁵| 2⁴| 2³| 2²| 2¹| 2⁰|
base 10 |128| 64| 32| 16| 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
```

For example, to represent 14, I set bit positions for the numbers 8, 4, 2

```text
bit     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
base 10 |128| 64| 32| 16| 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
          0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 14
```

Notice that, this encoding schema means the maximal number that can be represented by a byte is `255`, it means all bit
positions will be filled by 1, and the sum of all base 10.

### Logical operations

One of the things that makes magic in the world is `Logical operations on bits` are `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `SHIFT LEFT`,...

Let's perform some:

```text
| A | B | A&B | A|B | ^A |
| 0 | 0 |  0  |  0  |  1 |
| 0 | 1 |  0  |  1  |  1 |
| 1 | 0 |  0  |  1  |  0 |
| 1 | 1 |  1  |  1  |  0 |
```

SHIFT LEFT `<<` will shift all the bits one position to the left.

```text
00000011 (3) << 1
00000110 (6)
```

As you see above, `SHIFT LEFT` by 1 will multiply a number by 2, it means `2¹`
so `SHIFT LEFT` by 2 will be `2²`. Therefore, `A << n = A * (2^n)`

Similar to `SHIFT LEFT`, `SHIFT RIGHT(>>)` will shift all the bits one position to the right, if shift right by
`n` will be divided by `2^n`. Therefore, `A >> n = A / (2^n)`

```text
00000110 (6) >> 1
00000011 (3) 
```

*Dig deeper*

To calculate which bits are common between the numbers 5 `AND` 3 do the following:

```text
00000001 AND  (4, 1)
00000011      (2, 1)
--------------------
00000001      (1)
```

To join the bits between the numbers 5 `OR` 3 do the following.

```text
00000101 OR  (4, 1)
00000011     (2, 1)
-------------------
00000111     (4, 2, 1)
```

### Back to start

As I mentioned at the beginning that I have `the set of service keys are OCR, FM, LC, SCI`

I define the `ServiceKeySet` using an underlying type `uint8` (8 bit)

```go
type ServiceKeySet uint8
```

Then, I will make the available service keys that I will support as `Enum`(although Go has not Enum type =D)
by `SHIFT LEFT` by 1 (iota in Go)

```go
const(
    OCR ServiceKeySet = 1 << iota // 1
    FM                            // 2
    LC             // 4  
    SCI            // 8
    UnknownService // 16 
)
```

Above, my implementation will perform service as a number, in order to understand easily, I will represent my service
keys by nice strings.

```go
func (s ServiceKeySet) String() string {
    if s >= UnknownService {
        return fmt.Sprintf("<unknown service>")
    }

    switch s {
        case OCR:
            return "OCR"
        case FM:
            return "FaceMatching"
        case LC:
            return "LivenessCheck"
        case SCI:
            return "SanityCheckIdCard"
        default:
            var services []string
            for key := OCR; key < UnknownService; key <<= 1 { // multiply by 2 each loop
                if s&key != 0 {
                    services = append(services, key.String())
                }
            }
            return strings.Join(services, " - ")	
    }
}
```

Now, define your own user

```go
type User struct {
    Id string
    Services ServiceKeySet
}
```

Make a function that allows `User` register service.

```go
/*
   Register will add a key to the bitmark(Services)


   u.Services : 00000001 OR  (OCR)
   service    : 00000100     (LC)
   -----------------------------------
   result     : 00000101     (LC, OCR)
*/
func (u *User) Register(service ServiceKeySet) {
    u.Services |= service // Join by OR logical
}
```

By using bitwise `AND`, we can check for a service in the `Services`.

```go
/*
   Has will check a key in the bitmark (Services)
   @return bool

   u.Services : 00000101 AND (LC,OCR)
   service    : 00000100     (LC)
   -----------------------------------
   result     : 00000100     (LC)
*/
func (u *User) Has(service ServiceKeySet) bool{
    return u.Services&service != 0
}
```

Remove a service from `Services`

```go
/*
   Remove will remove a key from bitmark (Services)

   u.Services : 00000101 AND (LC,OCR)
   ^service   : 11111011     (LC)
   -----------------------------------
   result     : 00000001     (OCR)
*/
func (u *User) Remove(service ServiceKeySet) {
    u.Services &= ^service
}
```

Finally initialize a main function to execute the above functions

```go
func main() {
    user := User{ Id: "UserId", Services: OCR }
    user.Register(LC)
    fmt.Println(user.Services)
    fmt.Println("Has LC service: ", user.Has(LC))
    user.Remove(LC)
    fmt.Println(user.Services)
}
```

Tada, when running the main function will get expected response.

```
OCR - LivenessCheck
Has LC service:  true
OCR
```

### Memory cost comparison

Do a little math to compare between `[]string` and `bitmark` in terms of memory cost.

Assume that both `[]string` and `bitmark` must store 3 elements `OCR`, `FM`, `LC`.

For the string array represented by `[]string{"OCR", "FM", "LC"}`. It's easy to see that we needed 3 memory address to
store all the elements of our string array (`O(n) memory space`).

![String mem](../../../../../images/2021-05-22-bitmark/dsf.png)

For bitmark represented by `00000111` base 2, or 7 base 10, so we only need one memory to store 7 (`O(1) memory space`).

### Pros and Cons

**Pros**

- Look cool

+ Memory cost optimization

* Suitable for collecting problems such as collecting keys

**Cons**

- Difficult to understand and implement

* Difficult to maintain

+ Difficult to control

Happy coding :v !
